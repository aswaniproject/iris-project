## About the project

This project demonstrates the application of clustering techniques to the Iris dataset, a widely used dataset in data science and machine learning. The project implements two clustering algorithms—KMeans Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering—to group data points based on their similarity. The goal is to explore unsupervised learning methods and uncover natural groupings within the dataset.

## Objective of the project

The primary objective of this project is to evaluate and compare clustering techniques to gain insights into the structure of the dataset. Specifically, the project focuses on:
Loading and preprocessing the Iris dataset to prepare it for clustering.
Implementing KMeans Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering to group the data.
Visualizing and interpreting the clusters formed by each algorithm.
Understanding the strengths and limitations of each clustering method.

## DataSet

The Iris dataset is available in the sklearn library and contains:
Features:
Sepal Length (cm)
Sepal Width (cm)
Petal Length (cm)
Petal Width (cm)
Samples: 150
Species: Three species of Iris (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).
Note: The species column is dropped as clustering is an unsupervised learning task.

## Implementation
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
The dataset is loaded using the sklearn.datasets module.
The features are normalized using StandardScaler to ensure that all variables are on the same scale.
The species column is removed, as the clustering algorithms work on unlabeled data.

2.Clustering Algorithm
Description:
KMeans partitions the data into k clusters by iteratively assigning data points to the nearest cluster center and updating the centers.
Why KMeans for Iris?
KMeans works well for datasets with well-separated, spherical clusters like the Iris dataset.
Implementation Steps:
Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
Apply KMeans clustering with the chosen number of clusters.
Visualize the clusters in a 2D scatter plot.
B. Hierarchical Clustering
Description:
Hierarchical clustering builds a tree-like structure of clusters using either a bottom-up (agglomerative) or top-down (divisive) approach.
Why Hierarchical for Iris?
It provides insights into the hierarchical relationships between data points, making it suitable for small-to-medium datasets.
Implementation Steps:
Plot a dendrogram to visualize the hierarchical relationships.
Apply Agglomerative Clustering to form clusters.
Visualize the clusters in a 2D scatter plot.


## Results
KMeans Clustering Results:
The Elbow Method suggested three clusters, corresponding to the three species.
Clusters were visualized in a scatter plot, showing distinct groupings.
Hierarchical Clustering Results:
The dendrogram provided a hierarchical view of data relationships.
Agglomerative clustering grouped the data into three distinct clusters, similar to KMeans.
